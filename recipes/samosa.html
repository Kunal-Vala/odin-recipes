        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Dough: All-purpose flour (maida), water, salt 
            </li>
            <li>
                Filling: Boiled potatoes, green peas, chopped onions, ginger, green chilies, cumin seeds, coriander powder, red chili powder, garam masala 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, carom seeds, and salt. Add the oil or ghee and rub it into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.
            </li>
<br>
            <li>
                Make the filling: While the dough rests, heat the oil or ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and fennel seeds and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the asafoetida, ginger, and green chili and cook for 1 minute. Add the green peas and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, amchur, and salt. Add the potatoes and cilantro and cook for 2 minutes, or until the potatoes are heated through. Remove from heat and let cool.
            </li>
<br>
            <li>
                Assemble the samosas: Divide the dough into 12 equal portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion into a circle about 4 inches in diameter. Cut the circle in half.
                
            </li>
<br>
            <li>
                Shape the samosas: Take one half of the dough and fold it in half, forming a cone shape. Press the edges together to seal. Fill the cone with 2-3 tablespoons of the potato filling. Press the edges together to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
            </li>
<br>
            <li>
                Fry the samosas: Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the samosas, a few at a time, and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
